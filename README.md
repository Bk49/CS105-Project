# CS105-Project

## Part I: EDA

Submit a single Jupyter Notebook based on the given template, which must contain
• Point-by-point answers of the following issues;
• If applicable, corresponding codes that are reproducible (i.e., they produce output 
consistent with your answers), and well documented (in the form of comments and 
markdown cells).
You need to address the following issues. The percentages below add up to 100%, but they 
contribute to 8% of the overall grade of the course.

### 1. Overview of dataset [15%]
a. Summarize the background of the dataset.
b. State the size of the dataset.
c. For each variable, describe what it represents and its data type (numerical or 
categorical).

### 2. Data pre-processing [35%]
a. For each variable, determine the percentage of missing data. For any column with 
missing data, describe how you resolve the issue. Clearly state any assumption 
you made.
b. For each variable, identify outliers (if any) and describe how you resolve the issue.
Clearly state any assumption you made.
c. For categorical variables, perform the necessary encoding.

### 3. Exploratory analysis and visualization [50%]
a. For each variable, provide relevant summary statistics.
b. For each variable, provide an appropriate visualisation depicting the distribution 
of its values, and summarize any key observation(s) you made.
c. Perform bi-variate analyses on the variables. You do not need to analyse every
pair; only focus on the pairs you believe are worth investigating and explain your 
choices. For each pair, describe the relationship between the two variables. Use 
appropriate statistical methods and/or visualization.

## Part II: Modeling
Submit a single Jupyter Notebook based on the given template, which must contain
• Include Part I on EDA as well to produce a self-contained notebook. You may fine-tune 
Part I findings and/or codes based on feedback received on Part I submission;
• Point-by-point answers of the following issues;
• If applicable, corresponding codes that are reproducible (i.e., they produce output 
consistent with your answers), and well documented (in the form of comments and 
markdown cells). 

You need to address the following issues.

### 1. Problem formulation
a. Formulate one regression problem and one classification based on the dataset.
b. State which problem (regression or classification) you would be investigating and 
why.
c. Clearly specify the dependent variable you are predicting, and its significance.

### 2. Model training
a. Describe the steps taken to split the dataset into train and test sets
b. State the model(s) you will train on, and explain your choice(s). Please limit 
yourself to no more than three models—Grading is based on the validity and
soundness of your model, rather than the quantity.
c. For each model, perform the training, and report the trained parameters and the 
training scores, if applicable.

### 3. Model evaluation and selection
a. For each model, predict the response variable on the test set.
b. Describe the metric you use to evaluate your model(s). Report the test scores for 
each model.
c. If you trained more than one model, identify the final model you would choose
for the prediction task, and explain your choice.

### 4. Findings and conclusion
a. Interpret what your model is implying, and summarize any insight you have 
drawn from the project. Explain if it is consistent with intuition, and if not, provide 
a plausible justification.
b. Share any lesson you have learned from the project.

### 5. Team contribution
a. Describe the contribution of each member, including both the tangible (e.g.,
implementation and writing) and intangible (e.g. generating ideas, planning).

### 6. References
a. List any sources you have cited.
